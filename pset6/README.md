## CS50 Problem Set 6
This pset involved fundamental Python concepts, from basic syntax to control
flow, data structures, the standard library and the advantages and
disadvantages of higher level interpreted languages like Python to lower 
level languages such as C. The implications of Python being weakly as opposed
to statically typed.

* **Hello, Mario, Credit & Crack**
These four scripts are all direct ports from C to Python of the exercises 
completed earlier in the course. For the most part, Python makes it far 
easier to complete these tasks, although in some cases, such as with 
`crack.py`, the higher speed of C compared to Python is noticable.

* **Bleep**
This script reads in a user input string, parses each word individually
and replaces any words which appear in a user-defined 'banned words list' with
asterisks, printing the revised output. The wealth of string related methods 
available in Python make this a simple task.
