## CS50 Problem Set 5
This week's lecture and pset moved away from Python and onto web development.
Specifically, discussion of fundamental principles such as IP/TCP, HTTP and 
response codes, as well as how HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to build
webpages.

* **Homepage**
Homepage is a simple website consisting of four pages; `index.html`,
`about.html`, `education.html` and `coding.html`. These pages share a 
common stylesheet (`styles.css`) and contains elements from the Bootstrap
HTML/CSS framework.
